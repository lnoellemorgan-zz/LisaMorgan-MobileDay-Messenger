Coding Assignment for MobileDay interview process. -by Lisa Morgan

I elected to do the Messenger app for Android for a few reasons. 

  1. I am very familiar with Java so I didn't have to spend too much time learning coding syntax.
  2. Although I don't have much experience with Mobile development I wanted to give it a shot rather than creating a web app.
  3. My macbook is currently not functional due to a broken trackpad and apparently some liquid damage (according to the folks at the Apple store) so iOS is out. If anyone knows how to fix this without spending $750 I would love some advice! 

I do not have an Android device so all of my testing was done on the Android Virtual Device Manager. Based on my research I believe it should still work on an actual mobile device but please be aware that it has not been tested that way.

This is my first dive into Android development so there are probably some Dos and Don'ts that I have not followed. Any feedback is much appreicated.

Steps for running:
  1. Build and deploy on at least 2 Android mobile devices or Android emulators.
  2. On one device enter the Phone Number of the other device or emulator.
  3. Enter a message.
  4. Click Send! :)
